# Moodster
## Moodster is a Music Suggestion Website made possible through the use of Machine Learning.

### Description
Moodster is ideal for users that presently feel a certain way and would like to hear music that amplifies those feelings.

To hear music related to a certain mood, use the "Music For Your Mood" feature. Moodster also has a "Song Generator" feature that currently plays a unique song with the click of a button.

The website uses the [iTunes API](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/index.html) to pull songs that satisfy different moods. Moodster also uses the [Magenta.js](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/js-announce) JavaScript suite in the development of its Song Generator capabilities.
